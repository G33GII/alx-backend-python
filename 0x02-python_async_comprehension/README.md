# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

This project involves learning about asynchronous programming in Python, specifically focusing on async comprehensions. The key objectives are to understand the following:

1. **Asynchronous Generators**: Learn how to create and use asynchronous generators, which allow iteration over async data streams.
2. **Async Comprehensions**: Understand how to use async comprehensions to efficiently loop over asynchronous iterables.
3. **Concurrency with Asyncio**: Get acquainted with the `asyncio` module to manage asynchronous tasks and execute them concurrently.

The project includes hands-on tasks that help reinforce these concepts by implementing practical examples and writing Python code that leverages async comprehensions for various use cases.
